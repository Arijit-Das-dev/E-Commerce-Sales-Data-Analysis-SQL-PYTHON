# E-Commerce-Sales-Data-Analysis-SQL-PYTHON


##  Summary
This project focuses on analyzing E-Commerce Sales Data to uncover meaningful business insights.  
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and the analysis was performed using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and MySQL.

The workflow follows a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process:

1. *Extract* — Raw data imported from Kaggle  
2. *Transform* — Data cleaned and preprocessed using Python (Pandas)  
3. *Load* — Processed data stored in MySQL for structured querying  
4. *Visualize* — Insights represented using Matplotlib & Seaborn

##  Project Overview
In today’s digital world, e-commerce platforms generate massive amounts of data from customer interactions, online transactions, and product sales.  
To make informed business decisions, analyzing this data is crucial for identifying trends, improving customer experience, and increasing profitability.

This project performs a *comprehensive analysis* of an E-Commerce Sales Dataset to understand:
- Customer behavior and preferences  
- Sales performance by region and category  
- Business growth trends over time

##  Workflow
The project follows a *structured ETL pipeline*:

1. *Data Extraction:* Dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
2. *Data Transformation:* Cleaned missing values, handled irregularities, and standardized formats using Python (Pandas).  
3. *Data Loading:* Loaded processed data into *MySQL* for efficient querying and SQL-based analytics.  
4. *Visualization:* Used *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn* to visualize insights and trends.

## Analysis Highlights
The analysis covers multiple business dimensions, including:
-  *Top-performing cities and states*  
-  *Yearly and monthly order distribution*  
-  *Product category-wise sales trends*  
-  *Preferred payment methods*  
-  *Customer purchasing behavior*  

Advanced SQL and Python queries were applied to derive:
